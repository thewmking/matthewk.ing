          I'm a Raleigh, NC native with a background in digital marketing and a passion for solving puzzles with code. 
          You can find me working all over the stack, from front-end to back-end, as a product owner, manager, or individual contributor.
          I've worked modernizing legacy systems, building new products from scratch, and everything in between.
          I'm a big fan of Vue.js and Rails, but I'm always looking to learn new things and expand my skillset.
          I'm currently building ad tech of the future at Launch Labs.
